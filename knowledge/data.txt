What is an IRA?

With an IRA, you get a practical way to start or supplement your retirement savings. And it comes with tax breaks to boot.

An IRA (individual retirement account) is a personal, tax-deferred account the IRS created to give investors an easy way to save for retirement. It provides an excellent opportunity for your retirement money to grow and compound faster than it would in a taxable account.

You can open an IRA on your own through almost any bank, brokerage company, insurance firm, or investment company. And you can save your way for your retirement through the wide variety of investment choices that an IRA offers.
