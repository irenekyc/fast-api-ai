A Roth IRA is a type of retirement savings account that allows individuals to contribute after-tax income to the account, which grows tax-free until withdrawals are made in retirement. Unlike traditional IRAs, contributions made to a Roth IRA are not tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

The best account to use for retirement savings depends on your personal financial situation, including your income, tax bracket, and retirement goals.

A Roth IRA may be a good choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

What is the difference between a savings account and a retirement account?

In contrast, contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Additionally, 401(k) plans have higher contribution limits than Roth IRAs.

Why would I use a 401(k) over an IRA?
You may choose to use a 401(k) over an IRA for several reasons, including higher contribution limits, potential employer matching contributions, and the ability to take out loans or hardship withdrawals under certain circumstances. However, IRAs may offer greater flexibility in terms of investment options and lower fees.

Are 401(k)s only offered at my place of work?
401(k)s are typically offered as an employee benefit through a workplace, but some self-employed individuals or small business owners may also have access to a solo 401(k) plan.
