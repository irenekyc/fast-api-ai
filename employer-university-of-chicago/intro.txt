The University of Chicago offers three retirement plans for their employees. They are Contributory Retirement Plan (CRP), Retirement Income Plan for Employees (ERIP) and Supplemental Retirement Program (SRP).

Contributory Retirement Plan (CRP)
The Contributory Retirement Plan (CRP) is a 403(b) defined contribution plan that provides benefits through retirement savings accounts. Under CRP, you establish an account into which both you and the University contribute a percentage of your pay each pay period.
The University contributes 8% of your compensation and you contribute 5% by payroll deduction. These contributions and their investment earnings make up your retirement savings account from which you can draw a retirement income.

Retirement Income Plan for Employees (ERIP)
ERIP is a 403(b) defined contribution plan that provides benefits through retirement savings accounts. Under ERIP, you establish an account into which both you and the University contribute a percentage of your pay each pay period.
The University contributes 4% of your compensation and you contribute a mandatory 3% by payroll deduction. You have the option to voluntarily contribute up to an additional 2%, which will be matched up to 4% by the University.
Regular staff employees age 21 or older, who work at least 1,000 hours annually, must participate in the plan.

Supplemental Retirement Program (SRP)
You can begin saving for retirement immediately by taking advantage of the Supplemental Retirement Program. It is a voluntary plan under which you specify the dollar amount that you wish to contribute by payroll deduction each pay period.
The University does not contribute to your SRP account. Distributions from previous employers' retirement plans can be rolled over to the SRP. For more information, please contact TIAA.
