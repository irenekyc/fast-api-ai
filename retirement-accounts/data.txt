What is the best account to use for retirement savings?
The best account to use for retirement savings depends on your personal financial situation,
including your income, tax bracket, and retirement goals. Generally, a 401(k) plan is a good
choice if you have access to one through your employer, as it allows for higher contribution
limits and potential employer matching. A Roth IRA may be a good choice if you expect to be in
a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

What is the difference between a 401(k) and a Roth IRA?
A 401(k) is a retirement savings plan offered by employers, while a Roth IRA is an individual retirement account that you can open on your own. A 401(k) plan may offer employer matching contributions, but contributions are made with pre-tax dollars and withdrawals are generally taxable. In contrast, contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Additionally, 401(k) plans have higher contribution limits than Roth IRAs.

Why would I use a 401(k) over an IRA?
You may choose to use a 401(k) over an IRA for several reasons, including higher contribution limits, potential employer matching contributions, and the ability to take out loans or hardship withdrawals under certain circumstances. However, IRAs may offer greater flexibility in terms of investment options and lower fees.

What is the difference between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA?
The main difference between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA is how they are taxed. Contributions to a traditional IRA are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income. Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Additionally, traditional IRAs have required minimum distributions (RMDs) starting at age 72, while Roth IRAs do not have RMDs.
